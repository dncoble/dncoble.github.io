## *I do computer science except it's actually math except it's actually mechanical engineering.*

Hello -- I'm a student at the University of South Carolina studying mechanical engineering and mathematics. You can click around this website; see [about me](/about.html) for sort of extended resum√®, and [projects](/projects.html) for some non-research related projects I've done. Also, I may or may not be filling [posts](/posts.html) with occasional blogs. Before you leave, follow me on [GitHub](site.github_owner_url) and [LinkedIn](site.linkedin).
