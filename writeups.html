  These are derivations which I've done for some project or another. I try to write them up nice to help anyone else who might need them. In some of the work here I have been supported by university or national grants.
  <ul class="listing">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
      {% if post.category == "writeup"%}
	  {% unless post.draft %}
      <li>
		<span>
		{% for tag in post.tags %}
			{{ tag }} 
		{% endfor %}
		</span>
		<a href="{{ post.loc }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      </li>
	  {% endunless %}
      {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
