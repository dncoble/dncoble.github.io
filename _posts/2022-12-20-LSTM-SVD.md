Initially my Linear Algebra final project and continued as a research project, the idea here is to perform rank-reduction on long short-term memory (LSTM) cells, then decompose them to into a smaller form. The reduced models take less memory and computer quicker!

RMSE trend as weights are reduced from the model.
