My personal [website](nileliketheriver.net), built atop the [Left](https://github.com/holman/left) theme by Zach Holman.

Remember the magic words:

`bundle exec jekyll serve`
# To do

 * ~~Fix GitHub link~~
 * ~~fix profile picture~~
 * customize posts footer
 * fill website with about me, posts, and publications

# Left

Left is a clean, whitespace-happy layout for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

This is designed to be an easy layout to modify for your own blog. It was
extracted from [zachholman.com](http://zachholman.com/), which means it was
battle-hardened from years of posting serious blog posts about emoji and swear
words.

## Licensing

The Left theme is licensed as [MIT](https://github.com/holman/left/blob/gh-pages/LICENSE) with no
added caveats.
